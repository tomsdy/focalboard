# Create a new board

If none of the standard templates suit your requirements, you can create a blank board. Select the plus icon at the top of the sidebar, then select **Create New Board** to open the template picker and select the **Create empty board** option.

## Manage board details

If you've created a board, you can edit that board any time. To name or rename a board, select the title area to edit it.

To display board description, hover above the boardâ€™s title and select **Show description** to activate the show/hide toggle. Once the description field is displayed, select **Add a description** right below the board title to add or edit the description.

Boards and cards are created with random icons by default. To change or remove icons, select the icon then choose the appropriate action.

All changes you make to boards and cards are saved immediately.

## Create a template from a board

To turn an existing board into a template, hover over the board title in the sidebar. Select the options menu, then select **New template from board**.
