# Link boards to Mattermost channels

## Link a board to a channel

Boards can be linked to channels and accessed from the channel Apps Bar.

1. Select the **Focalboard** icon from the Apps Bar in a channel to open a right-hand sidebar (RHS).
2. Search for and link boards to the channel.
3. Select **Add** button to open the link boards dialog and search for a board to link.

Once a board is linked to a channel, it's listed in the right-hand pane. Linking a board to a channel automatically grants all channel members access to the board, with the exception of guest accounts. Select a linked board to navigate directly to the board.

**Notes**:
- A channel can be linked to multiple boards, but each individual board can only be linked to one channel at a time.
- Linking the same board to another channel will automatically replaces the link to the previous channel with the new channel.
- Channel members can only search and link boards within the team where they are a board admin.
- If you're using a Focalboard plugin older than v7.2, you won't be able to link a board to a channel. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of the plugin to take full advantage of all plugin features and functionality.
- After upgrading to version v7.2 or later of the Focalboard plugin, your boards automatically appear in the right-hand side pane for easy access.

## Unlink a board from a channel

If you're a board admin, and want to unlink a board from a channel you're in, open linked board, select the options menu, and select **Unlink**.

Alternatively, you can open the **Share** dialog on the board, open the **Role** drop-down menu next to the channel's name and select **Unlink**.
