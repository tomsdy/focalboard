# Responsible Disclosure Policy

Safety and data security is of utmost priority for the Focalboard community. If you are a security researcher and have discovered a security vulnerability in our code base, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Please contact us at `chen [at] mattermost.com` to report any security vulnerabilities found in our open source code base. 

Please refrain from requesting compensation for reporting vulnerabilities.

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and send you regular updates about our progress.

If your report is reproducible as an exploit and results in a change to the code base or documentation of a Focalboard product, we will–-at your option–-publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure.

After a fix is made, we ask security researchers to wait 30 days after a release before announcing the specific details of a vulnerability, and to provide Focalboard with a link to any such announcements. In releases containing security fixes, Focalboard announces an update is available, acknowledges the contributions of security researches, and it withholds specific details until 30 days after availability to give time for the community to apply updates.

You are not allowed to search for vulnerabilities on any instance of Focalboard hosted by the team, users, or customers with the exception of non-disruptive testing on the community test server mentioned above.

Focalboard is open source software, you can install a copy yourself and test against that.

Many thanks to the security researchers who have responsibly contributed their findings to make the Focalboard code base more secure (listed by number of contributions, then alphabetically).
