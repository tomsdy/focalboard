### Meeting Agenda Template

We've been using Focalboard on the [community server](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/discussions/349) for a few weeks now, and a few unexpected use-cases have emerged. One of them is using Focalboard for recurring meeting agendas, like team meetings and 1:1s.

For my own meetings, I started with the project tasks template, but have found for following columns work better:
* To Discuss
* Revisit Later
* Done / Archived

Meeting participants queue new items under **To Discuss**. As we go through them, most are moved to done, but a few need followup. We move those to the **Revisit Later** column. The owner then moves it back to **To Discuss** for a future meeting.

Here's [the archive of the template](https://community.mattermost.com/core/pl/5qo11pe837ykue15bne9ke1snc) if you would like to try this out yourself:
* Download the .focalboard archive file from the thread above
* Select "Import Archive" under Settings at the lower left
* Pick the archive file
* (You may need to refresh the browser)
* Click on **+ Add Board**, and pick "Meeting Agenda"
