Mattergoals is a project management board. It shows all your tasks at a glance, their status, who is working on them, and what is coming up next.

Two editions are currently available, both as free / open source projects:
* **Personal Desktop**: a standalone desktop app for managing your personal tasks
* **Personal Server**: a self-hosted server for your team to use together

### Why we built it

We believe the space for collaboration apps is ripe for innovation. While there are many public SaaS options for project management, there's a conspicuous lack of competitive self-hosted alternatives, and open source alternatives in particular.

We think Mattergoals can offer a viable alternative with an **open core** model: the free / open source editions are built for **individuals and developers**, and (future) paid editions will be built for **team managers** and **IT professionals** who need additional enterprise features.

We have made early releases of the personal editions available as open source because we want to **hear from you**. Is this something you or your team would use? What would make it more useful for you? And, would you like to contribute code or ideas to help us advance the project?

### How to get involved

[Download the personal editions here](/download), and let us know what you think in the community forum.

If you are a developer, get the source code on GitHub. We welcome pull requests following the steps here. Check out the list of open tickets for the most high-impact ways to contribute.

We are also hiring! Contributing a PR is also a great way to see what working at Mattermost is like.
