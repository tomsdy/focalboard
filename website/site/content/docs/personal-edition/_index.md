If you are new to Focalboard, [Personal Desktop](desktop) is the fastest way to try it out.

To use it with your team, use [Mattermost Boards](../mattermost).
You can import boards from Personal Desktop to Mattermost Boards.

You can also set up the standalone Development or Personal Server on [Ubuntu](ubuntu) or with [Docker](docker).
