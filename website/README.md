## Production Notes

### For Assets (stylesheets, scripts, images)

If there are changes, please make sure that you change files names or update the version in the asset URLâ€™s query string to help override the browser cache.
The main stylesheet (styles.css) can change quite frequently, so to update the version across all pages, you can go into `layouts/partials/head.html` and adjust the `version` query param.
